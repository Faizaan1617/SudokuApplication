A Sudoku is a puzzle which consists of a 9x9 grid of numbers ranging from 1-9. This grid is subdivided into smaller grids of dimensions 3x3.
The objective of the puzzle is to fill this grid with the numbers such that each digit only appears once in a row, column and in the
subdivided 3x3 grid. A matrix of ints is used to represent the grid.

The application is built on the following assumptions:
1) The value of any of the numbers on the grid is not less than 1 or greater than 9.
2) The grid is filled out, meaning that there are no empty spaces.
